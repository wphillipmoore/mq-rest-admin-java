Owns authentication, base URL construction,   request/response handling, and diagnostic state. Provides generated   command methods for all MQSC commands. A single session represents a   connection to one queue manager's REST API.</p> <p>Command methods : ~144 generated MQSC command methods. Each method is a thin wrapper that   calls the internal command dispatcher with the correct command verb and   qualifier. Method names follow the pattern <code>verb_qualifier</code> (or   <code>verbQualifier</code> in camelCase languages), mapping directly to MQSC   commands. For example, <code>DISPLAY QUEUE</code> becomes <code>display_queue</code> /   <code>displayQueue</code>, and <code>DEFINE QLOCAL</code> becomes <code>define_qlocal</code> /   <code>defineQlocal</code>.</p> <p>Ensure methods : 16 idempotent ensure methods for declarative object management. Each   method checks current state with DISPLAY, then DEFINE, ALTER, or no-ops   as needed. Returns an ensure result indicating what action was taken.   The queue manager variant is a special singleton (no name, no DEFINE).   Only changed attributes are sent in ALTER commands, preserving   <code>ALTDATE</code>/<code>ALTTIME</code> audit timestamps.</p> <p>Mapping pipeline : Bidirectional attribute translation between developer-friendly names and   native MQSC parameter names. Includes key mapping (attribute names),   value mapping (enumerated values), and key-value mapping (combined   name+value translations). The mapping tables were bootstrapped from   IBM MQ 9.4 documentation and cover all standard MQSC attributes.</p> <p>Exception hierarchy : Structured error types for transport failures, malformed responses,   authentication errors, MQSC command errors, and polling timeouts.   All exceptions carry diagnostic context including the full MQ response   payload when available.</p> <p>In the Java implementation, the core components map to these classes:</p> <ul> <li><code>MqRestSession</code>: The main entry point. A single class (no mixin   decomposition) that owns connection details, authentication, mapping   configuration, diagnostic state, and all ~144 command methods plus 16   ensure methods. Created via a builder pattern.</li> <li>Command methods: Generated methods on <code>MqRestSession</code> (e.g.   <code>displayQueue()</code>, <code>defineQlocal()</code>, <code>deleteChannel()</code>). Each method is a   thin wrapper that calls the internal <code>mqscCommand()</code> dispatcher with the   correct verb and qualifier.</li> <li><code>AttributeMapper</code>: Handles bidirectional attribute translation using   <code>MappingData</code> loaded from a JSON resource file. See the   Mapping Pipeline for details.</li> <li>Exception hierarchy: Sealed exception classes rooted at <code>MqRestException</code>.
