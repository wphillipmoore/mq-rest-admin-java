## Bug fixes

- **add type-specific queue delete methods and remove integration test workarounds (#190)**
Add deleteQlocal, deleteQremote, deleteQalias, and deleteQmodel methods to MqRestSession. Replace all raw mqscCommand() workarounds in integration tests with the new public API methods, achieving parity with the Python, Go, and Ruby SDKs.


## CI

- **add SonarCloud quality analysis to CI (#180)**
- **add SonarCloud post-merge workflow (#181)**
Runs SonarCloud analysis on push to develop so the project dashboard reflects the latest merged code.

- **add Code Climate (Qlty) coverage upload (#183)**
Add codeclimate job to ci.yml and codeclimate.yml post-merge workflow for Qlty Cloud coverage tracking via OIDC.

- **assign unique REST API ports per integration test matrix entry (#186)**
* ci: assign unique REST API ports per integration test matrix entry


## Features

- **run integration tests with same Java version matrix as unit tests (#184)**
Integration tests now run against Java 17, 21, and 25-ea instead of only 17, matching the unit test matrix for consistent coverage.


## Testing

- **add LTPA auth integration test (#188)**
Adds LTPA authentication test to match Python, Go, and Ruby integration test coverage. Uses Assumptions.abort() to gracefully skip on MQ developer containers that do not return LtpaToken2 cookies.
