Ref wphillipmoore/mq-dev-environment#14

- **ban MEMORY.md usage in CLAUDE.md (#154)**
Add auto-memory policy requiring agents to discuss behavioral rules with the human rather than storing them in unmanaged MEMORY.md files.

- **ban heredocs in shell commands (#155)**
Add explicit ban on heredocs for multi-line CLI arguments. Always use temp files instead.


## Features

- **add canonical local validation script (#128)**
Add scripts/dev/validate_local.sh that checks prerequisites (java, mvnw)
and runs ./mvnw verify as a single fail-fast command. Update
repository-standards.md with canonical_local_validation_command and
CLAUDE.md to reference the script.

- **add shared tooling sync from standard-tooling v1.0.0**
Sync all shared scripts from standard-tooling canonical source.
Adds lint scripts (commit-messages.sh, markdown-standards.sh,
pr-issue-linkage.sh, repo-profile.sh) and dev scripts
(finalize_repo.sh, sync-tooling.sh) not previously present.

- **add category prefixes to job names (#150)**
Standardize job display names with category prefixes so checks cluster naturally in the GitHub status list.

- **adopt validate_local.sh dispatch architecture (#156)**
* feat(validate): adopt validate_local.sh dispatch architecture

Add primary_language: java to repo profile. Replace repo-specific validate_local.sh with synced driver and language-specific scripts from standard-tooling.


## Refactoring

- **use shared docs-deploy composite action (#140)**
- **use shared composite actions for publish and release gates (#146)**
Replace inline tag/release, version bump PR, and version divergence gate logic with reusable composite actions from standard-actions.

- publish.yml: use tag-and-release and version-bump-pr actions
- ci.yml: use version-divergence action for release gates
