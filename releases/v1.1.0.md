# Release 1.1.0 (2026-02-16)

## Bug fixes

- **resolve three CI job failures (#27)**
- standards-compliance: fix markdown lint errors (MD031 blanks around
  fences, MD040 missing code language, MD060 table separator spacing)
  in tier3-decisions.md, admin-rest-api-gap-analysis.md, and
  mq-java-ecosystem.md
- dependency-audit: replace dependency-review-action (requires
  Dependency Graph enabled) with mvnw dependency:tree for all events
- release-gates: guard version divergence check against missing
  pom.xml on main branch

- **add blank line and Table of Contents to README.md (#29)**
Fix MD022 (blanks-around-headings) and add required Table of Contents
section to satisfy standards-compliance checks.

- **sync mapping data with pymqrest and extract parameters from response (#38)**
Sync mapping-data.json with the authoritative pymqrest mapping_data.py:
add DELETE QALIAS/QLOCAL/QMODEL/QREMOTE commands, add missing response
key mappings across 9 qualifiers, and add request key-value mappings for
listener replace/noreplace.

Fix a response parsing bug where completionCode, reasonCode, and the
parameters wrapper from the MQ REST API commandResponse envelope were
included as MQ object attributes. Now only the contents of the
parameters sub-object are returned, matching pymqrest behavior.

Update integration tests to use correct mapped attribute names (lowercase
replace values, transmission_queue_name, default_input_open_option,
start_mode) and specific DELETE qualifiers (QLOCAL, QREMOTE, etc.)
instead of the generic DELETE QUEUE.

- **disable MD041 for mkdocs snippet-include files**
The docs/site/docs/mappings/*.md files are mkdocs snippet includes
(--8<-- directives), not standalone markdown documents. MD041 (first
line must be a heading) false-positives on these. The awk structural
check in standards-compliance already enforces single-H1 for real docs.

- **correct table column count in local MQ container docs**
Merge the separate QM1/QM2 REST base URL rows into a single row with
three columns to satisfy MD056 (table column count consistency).

- **correct snippets base_path resolution for fragment includes (#74)**
pymdownx.snippets resolves base_path relative to CWD (not the mkdocs.yml
location). The previous paths were relative to docs/site/ which caused
fragments to either not resolve or self-include when the wrapper file
had the same name as the fragment.

Use CWD-relative paths so fragments resolve correctly when mkdocs is
invoked from the repository root.

Fixes wphillipmoore/mq-rest-admin-common#32

- **run mike from repo root so snippet base_path resolves in CI (#75)**
Remove working-directory from mike deploy step and pass
-F docs/site/mkdocs.yml instead, so CWD matches the base_path
entries in mkdocs.yml.

Ref wphillipmoore/mq-rest-admin-common#32

- **propagate 4 missing mapping entries from canonical JSON (#80)**
Propagates the fix from mq-rest-admin-common#40 restoring 4 entries
dropped during the initial extraction from the Python source:

- conn.response_key_map: ASTATE, CONN, EXTCONN
- qstatus.request_key_map: type


## Documentation

- **record tier 1 decisions (groupId, Java 17, Maven) (#2)**
Document the three foundational decisions: Maven groupId
(io.github.wphillipmoore), minimum Java version (17), and build tool
(Maven). Update open-decisions tracker to reflect resolved items and
implicitly converged publishing decisions.

- **record tier 3 architecture decisions (#5)**
Document HTTP client (java.net.http), JSON library (Gson), API surface
(method-per-command with Map params), attribute mapping (3-layer pipeline
port), and exception hierarchy (unchecked, sealed) decisions. Add Gson
2.13.2 compile dependency. Update CLAUDE.md architecture section and
mark all 5 architecture items as decided in open-decisions.md.

- **update open-decisions to reflect completed implementation (#32)**
Update purpose to note all library code is implemented with only
tooling remaining. Update git hooks entry to reflect adoption of
canonical versions from standards-and-conventions (PR #31).

- **add documentation site generator to open decisions (#37)**
- **enrich ensure-methods and getting-started pages (#45)**
Rewrite ensure-methods.md with full explanatory content from enriched
common fragment plus detailed Java code examples (basic usage,
assertions, queue manager singleton, configuration management).

Rewrite getting-started.md to match pymqrest depth: add strict/lenient
mapping, custom overrides with sparse examples, gateway queue manager,
diagnostic state, and richer error handling examples.

- **enrich documentation pages and remove inline TOC sections (#47)**
Enrich all MkDocs documentation pages to match pymqrest reference depth:
- architecture.md: Java component mapping, diagnostic state, transport
  interface, mock transport example, gateway builder example
- mapping-pipeline.md: Java examples for every section, per-call opt-out,
  corrected snake_case naming (was incorrectly documented as camelCase)
- API reference pages: complete command tables (~144 methods by verb),
  auth recommendations (LTPA vs Basic), exception method tables and
  catch examples, transport parameter docs, mapping sub-map details
- ensure.md: fixed swapped EnsureResult/EnsureAction descriptions

Fix incorrect attribute names and API references in code examples:
- max_q_depth -> max_queue_depth, current_depth -> current_queue_depth
- statistics_queue -> queue_statistics, monitoring_queue -> queue_monitoring
- e.getReasonCode() -> e.getStatusCode(), e.getCommandResponse() -> e.getPayload()

Remove inline Table of Contents sections from all docs/site/ pages.
MkDocs Material provides integrated navigation, making them redundant.
Exempt per standards-and-conventions#152 and standard-actions#11.

- **add sync hallucination case study (#48)**
Root cause analysis of the fabricated sync documentation (issue #44).
The doc agent invented a Terraform-style bulk declarative sync system
instead of documenting the actual synchronous polling wrappers that
were correctly ported from pymqrest.

- **rewrite sync documentation to match actual implementation (#49)**
The sync docs incorrectly described a bulk declarative configuration
management system (Terraform-style sync). Replace with the correct
documentation: synchronous polling wrappers around fire-and-forget
START/STOP commands, matching the Python reference implementation.

See docs/research/2026-02-14-sync-hallucination-case-study.md for
forensic analysis of how the hallucination occurred.

- **close content gaps in ensure, sync, mapping, and getting-started pages (#57)**
* docs: close content gaps in ensure, sync, mapping, and getting-started pages

Inline all narrative content that was previously referenced via --8<--
snippet directives pointing to the non-existent .mq-rest-admin-common
fragments directory. The shared fragment architecture will be revisited
when the Go repo docs are built.

- **replace BasicAuth with LtpaAuth in examples and remove Next Steps (#61)**
- **address medium-severity documentation consistency findings (#63)**
Enrich contributing.md with AI agent guidance, developer-setup.md with
required-repos and CI overview, local-mq-container.md with gateway routing
and environment variables, add diagnostic attributes to sync timeout example,
add LTPA default note to auth.md, create ai-engineering.md, and set dark
mode as default theme palette.

- **address cross-library documentation consistency nits (#67)**
Standardize nav ordering with full qualifier mapping listings, create
examples page, add runtime dependencies and pipeline links to
architecture page, and remove Quick Links from home page.

- **switch to shared fragment includes from common repo (#71)**
Replace duplicated mapping pages, AI engineering, and local MQ container
docs with --8<-- snippet includes from mq-rest-admin-common. Delete
generate_mapping_docs.py (moved to common) and remove the generate step
from the docs workflow.

- **add quality gates documentation page**
Include the shared quality gates fragment from mq-rest-admin-common and
append Java-specific validation pipeline details (Spotless, Checkstyle,
Surefire, Failsafe, JaCoCo, SpotBugs, PMD).

- **close stale documentation generator TBD in open-decisions**
The MkDocs decision was made in PRs #42 and #68 but open-decisions.md
still listed it as TBD. Update to reflect the decision and clarify
the remaining docs-only validation gap.


## Features

- **add repository scaffolding and research documents (#1)**
Establish the repository structure adapted from pymqrest, including
CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md dual-file documentation strategy, canonical
standards references, issue templates, markdownlint config, changelog
config, and Java-specific .gitignore. Add research documents covering
the MQ Java ecosystem survey, admin REST API gap analysis, project
naming decision, and open decisions tracker.

- **add Maven project skeleton (#3)**
Set up the Maven build with project coordinates
(io.github.wphillipmoore:mq-rest-admin:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT), Java 17 compiler
configuration, and Maven Wrapper (3.3.4 / Maven 3.9.12). Create the
standard src directory layout with package-info.java as the compilation
placeholder. Update CLAUDE.md and repository-standards.md with concrete
development commands.

- **add testing framework and code quality tooling (#4)**
Add JUnit 5, Mockito 5, AssertJ for testing with JaCoCo 100% coverage
enforcement. Add Spotless + google-java-format, Checkstyle, SpotBugs, and
PMD for full static analysis from day 1. Single command `./mvnw verify`
runs the entire validation pipeline.

- **implement sealed exception hierarchy (#7)**
- **add transport interface and response record (#8)**
Define the HTTP boundary types that all session logic depends on:
- TransportResponse record with defensive header copying
- MqRestTransport interface with single postJson method

- **add auth types (Credentials sealed interface + records) (#9)**
Implement the credential model for MQ REST API authentication as step 3
of the implementation sequence. Adds sealed Credentials interface with
three record implementations: BasicAuth, LtpaAuth, and CertificateAuth.

- **add mapping issue types (MappingIssue record + MappingException) (#11)**
Step 4 of tier 3 implementation: define the error-reporting model for
attribute translation failures. MappingDirection and MappingReason enums,
MappingIssue record, and MappingException (separate from MqRestException
hierarchy, as it represents data-transformation errors).

- **implement attribute mapping pipeline (AttributeMapper + MappingData + MappingOverrideMode) (#12)**
Implement the 3-layer attribute mapping pipeline that translates between
snake_case Python-style attribute names and MQSC parameter names used by
the MQ REST API. This is step 5 of the tier 3 implementation sequence.

- MappingOverrideMode enum (MERGE/REPLACE strategies)
- MappingData class (JSON loading, factory methods, override merging)
- AttributeMapper class (key map, value map, key-value map pipeline)
- Minimal mapping-data.json resource skeleton for testing
- 75 new tests (165 total), 100% line and branch coverage

- **implement MqRestSession core with Builder, mqscCommand, and helpers (#13)**
Central session class that ties together URL/header building, MQSC command
dispatch, response parsing, error detection, and attribute mapping integration.

- MqRestSession with Builder pattern (required: URL, qmgr, credentials, transport)
- mqscCommand method: full pipeline mirroring pymqrest _mqsc_command
- LTPA login at construction time for LtpaAuth credentials
- Response parameter mapping and WHERE keyword mapping
- Session state tracking (lastHttpStatus, lastResponseText, lastResponsePayload,
  lastCommandPayload)
- MappingData: add getResponseParameterMacros() and getSnakeToMqscMap() methods
- MappingData: make hasQualifier() public (needed by session)
- 100 new tests (280 total), 100% line and branch coverage

- **add 118 command methods to MqRestSession (#14)**
Add thin command methods that delegate to mqscCommand(), providing the
public API surface users call (e.g., displayQueue(), defineQlocal()).

Six method patterns cover all MQSC commands:
- Wildcard DISPLAY (2): displayQueue, displayChannel default to "*"
- Singleton DISPLAY (3): displayQmgr/Qmstatus/Cmdserv return Map
- Optional-name DISPLAY (39): return List<Map>
- Required-name void (7): 5 DEFINEs + 2 DELETEs with null check
- Optional-name void (56): most non-DISPLAY commands
- No-name void (11): QMGR/CMDSERV commands

- **add ensure package (EnsureAction, EnsureResult) and 16 ensure methods on MqRestSession (#15)**
Implements idempotent upsert operations that create-if-not-exists,
update-if-different, or leave-unchanged for MQ objects. Mirrors
pymqrest MQRESTEnsureMixin.

New types:
- EnsureAction enum: CREATED, UPDATED, UNCHANGED
- EnsureResult record: action + changed attribute names

New methods on MqRestSession:
- valuesMatch(): case-insensitive string comparison helper
- extractParametersMap(): unwraps MQ REST API parameters sub-object
- ensureObject(): core ensure logic (private)
- ensureQmgr(): special case (never CREATED)
- 15 standard ensure methods: ensureQlocal, ensureQremote, ensureQalias,
  ensureQmodel, ensureChannel, ensureAuthinfo, ensureListener,
  ensureNamelist, ensureProcess, ensureService, ensureTopic, ensureSub,
  ensureStgclass, ensureComminfo, ensureCfstruct

- **add sync package (SyncOperation, SyncConfig, SyncResult) and 9 sync methods on MqRestSession (#18)**
Add synchronous start/stop/restart methods with polling for channels,
listeners, and services. Includes Clock abstraction for deterministic
testing, ObjectTypeConfig for object type dispatch, and hasStatus helper
for status detection. 591 tests, 100% coverage.

- **add git hooks for branch protection, commit message, and co-author validation (#21)**
Ports pre-commit (branch protection + naming) and commit-msg hooks
from pymqrest, adapted for the library branching model. Adds a new
co-author trailer validator that checks against the approved identity
list in docs/repository-standards.md.

- **implement HttpClientTransport with JDK HttpClient (#19)**
Provides the real HTTP transport behind MqRestTransport using
java.net.http.HttpClient and Gson — zero additional runtime
dependencies. Supports TLS verification toggle, custom SSLContext
for mTLS, timeout propagation, and RFC 9110 header flattening.

- **populate mapping-data.json with full MQ attribute set (#23)**
Port all 139 MQSC commands, 50 qualifiers, and ~1,300+ attribute
mappings from pymqrest's mapping_data.py to the JSON resource file.
Update tests to use real attribute names (max_queue_depth vs stub's
max_depth.

)

- **add GitHub Actions CI workflow with 6-job pipeline (#25)**
Set up CI with docs-only detection, standards compliance, dependency
audit (GitHub-native dependency-review-action), release gates (SNAPSHOT
and version divergence checks), test-and-validate (Java 17/21/25
matrix running full mvnw verify), and integration-tests placeholder.

- **add Error Prone, NullAway, and JSpecify null-safety tooling (#30)**
Add static analysis tooling and fix Java naming standard deviations
tracked in issue #17.

Error Prone + NullAway configured in a JDK 21+ Maven profile so CI
on Java 21/25 enforces null-safety at ERROR severity while Java 17
builds compile normally. JSpecify @Nullable annotations applied across
all source files. Abbreviated variable names expanded per naming
standard Rule 3, and test method abbreviations (ThrowsNpe) replaced
with full names (ThrowsNullPointerException).

- **adopt canonical git hooks from standards-and-conventions (#31)**
Replace hardcoded hook scripts with dynamic branching-model-aware
versions from standards-and-conventions#141. The pre-commit hook now
reads branching_model from docs/repository-standards.md instead of
hardcoding allowed prefixes, and co-author.sh gains whitespace
normalization for trailer comparison.

- **add integration test strategy and MQ dev wrapper scripts (#6)**
Document per-project container isolation via COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME and
port allocation. Add wrapper scripts in scripts/dev/ that delegate to
mq-dev-environment with mq-rest-admin-specific ports (9453/9454).

- **wire up CI integration tests with live MQ containers (#35)**
Replace the placeholder integration-tests CI job with a real workflow
that starts MQ containers via the mq-dev-environment composite action
and runs Failsafe integration tests against the live REST API.

- CI job: checkout mq-dev-environment, setup-mq with ports 9453/9454,
  run ./mvnw verify with MQ_REST_ADMIN_RUN_INTEGRATION=1
- JaCoCo: exclude *IT.class from 100% coverage enforcement
- MqRestSessionIT: display, lifecycle, ensure, gateway, and session
  state tests mirroring pymqrest test_mq_integration.py

- **add MkDocs documentation site with shared fragment architecture (#41)**
* feat: add MkDocs documentation site with shared fragment architecture

Implement cross-repo documentation architecture with a shared common
fragments repo and a Java MkDocs Material site. Includes mapping docs
generator, maven-javadoc-plugin, CI workflow for GitHub Pages, and
complete doc pages for architecture, API reference, and development.

- **add Tier 1 security tooling (CodeQL, attestations, license compliance)**
- Add CodeQL SAST job to CI workflow using standard-actions composite action
- Add build provenance attestations to publish workflow (attest-build-provenance@v2)
- Add license compliance check to dependency-audit job using license-maven-plugin

- **add Trivy and Semgrep CI jobs and SBOM generation**
Add Trivy filesystem vulnerability scanning and Semgrep SAST jobs to CI,
gated by docs-only detection. Add CycloneDX SBOM generation to the
publish workflow, attached to GitHub Releases.

Ref mq-rest-admin-common#11, #24, #25

- **configure Maven Central publication via Central Portal API**
Add a release Maven profile with source, javadoc, GPG signing, and
central-publishing-maven-plugin. Update the publish workflow to import
GPG keys, authenticate with Central Portal, and deploy artifacts.
GitHub Release notes now show Maven/Gradle coordinates.
