# Release 1.1.1 (2026-02-16)

## Bug fixes

- **set docs default version to latest on main deploy**
The root URL redirect was pointing to dev/ because mike set-default
was never called. Add mike set-default latest after deploying from
main so the root URL always redirects to the latest release.

- **allow commits on release/* branches in library-release model**
The pre-commit hook blocked commits on release/* branches, which
prevents prepare_release.py from committing the changelog. Remove
release/* from the universal protected set and add release/ to the
library-release allowed prefixes.

- **remove PR_BUMP_TOKEN and add issue linkage to version bump PR**
Replace secrets.PR_BUMP_TOKEN fallback with github.token since the
default GITHUB_TOKEN has sufficient permissions for PR creation when
the workflow declares pull-requests: write. Remove the explicit remote
URL override that was only needed for the PAT-based auth.

After creating the version bump PR, edit its body to include a
self-referencing Ref #N, then close and reopen it so branch protection
rules re-evaluate the PR event, and finally enable auto-merge.


## Documentation

- **refresh CLAUDE.md with current project state (#91)**
Remove stale meta-documentation about the dual-file strategy, update
version from 0.1.0-SNAPSHOT to 1.1.1, add single-test commands,
document git hooks (Conventional Commits, co-author validation),
branching model details, and NullAway/JSpecify usage.
