# AI-assisted engineering

## Transparency statement

`mq-rest-admin` is an AI-assisted engineering project. Significant portions of
the codebase were developed collaboratively between a human engineer and
AI coding agents. This page documents what was AI-generated, what was
human-designed, and how quality was maintained.

### Tools used

- **Claude Code** (Anthropic) — interactive pair-programming agent
- **Codex** (OpenAI) — autonomous task execution agent

## What was AI-generated

**Mapping data bootstrap**: The `mapping-data.json` resource file was
originally bootstrapped from IBM MQ 9.4 documentation using an AI-assisted
extraction pipeline. The pipeline parsed MQSC and PCF command references to
propose `snake_case` attribute names, value mappings, and command metadata
for all 48 qualifiers. The automated output was then reviewed, customized,
and rationalized by hand. `mapping-data.json` is now maintained directly
as the sole authoritative source — the extraction pipeline is archived
in the Python repository at `docs/archive/extraction/`.

**Command method generation**: The ~144 MQSC command wrapper methods are
generated from the command definitions in `mapping-data.json`. Each method
is a thin wrapper with the correct verb, qualifier, and return type.

**Mapping documentation**: The 48 qualifier mapping pages in this
documentation were generated by `scripts/dev/generate_mapping_docs.py`
from the same mapping data source.

**Implementation code**: Much of the session, mapping, transport, and test
code was written through AI-assisted pair programming, with the AI agent
proposing implementations and the human engineer reviewing, refining, and
directing the design.

## What was human-designed

**Architecture and API design**: The overall design — single-endpoint via
`runCommandJSON`, qualifier-based mapping, method naming conventions,
return shape rules, error handling strategy — was conceived and directed
by the human engineer.

**Quality standards**: The requirement for 100% test coverage (JaCoCo line
and branch), strict formatting (Spotless + google-java-format), style
enforcement (Checkstyle), bug analysis (SpotBugs), and code smell detection
(PMD) were human-defined standards.

**Design decisions**: Key choices like the mapping opt-out mechanism,
strict vs lenient modes, the transport abstraction, and the sealed
exception hierarchy were human decisions refined through discussion.

## Quality assurance

The AI-assisted development process maintains quality through:

**100% test coverage**: Every line and branch of production code is
covered by unit tests. Coverage is enforced as a CI hard gate via JaCoCo
at the BUNDLE level.

**Formatting and style**: Spotless with google-java-format enforces
consistent 2-space indentation and import ordering. Checkstyle with
`google_checks.xml` enforces naming and structural conventions.

**Static analysis**: SpotBugs (max effort, low threshold) catches bug
patterns. PMD catches code smells. Both run as CI hard gates.

**Validation pipeline**: `./mvnw verify` runs the same checks as CI:
formatting → style → compile → unit tests → integration tests → coverage
→ SpotBugs → PMD.

**Integration testing**: Containerized IBM MQ queue managers provide
real MQSC command validation. Integration tests verify that mapping
assumptions hold against actual MQ responses.

## The `Co-Authored-By` convention

Commits that involved AI assistance include a `Co-Authored-By` trailer
identifying the agent used:

```text

Co-Authored-By: wphillipmoore-codex <255923655+wphillipmoore-codex@users.noreply.github.com>
```

This provides a transparent, auditable record of AI involvement in the
project's git history.
