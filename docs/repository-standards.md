## Pre-flight checklist

- Before modifying any files, check the current branch with `git status -sb`.
- If on `develop`, create a short-lived `feature/*` branch or ask for explicit approval to proceed on `develop`.
- If approval is granted to work on `develop`, call it out in the response and proceed only for that user-approved scope.
- Enable repository git hooks before committing: `git config core.hooksPath scripts/git-hooks`.

- supported_release_lines: current and previous

## Local validation

```bash
./mvnw verify           # Full validation pipeline (formatting, style, compile,
                        # tests, coverage, SpotBugs, PMD)
./mvnw clean verify     # Clean full validation
./mvnw compile          # Compile only
./mvnw test             # Unit tests only
./mvnw spotless:apply   # Auto-format code
```

## Tooling requirement

Required for daily workflow:

- Java 17+ (`brew install openjdk@17` or SDKMAN)
- Maven Wrapper (`./mvnw`, checked into repo -- no separate Maven install needed)
- `markdownlint` (required for docs validation and PR pre-submission)

## Merge strategy override

- Feature, bugfix, and chore PRs targeting `develop` use squash merges (`--squash`).
- Release PRs targeting `main` use regular merges (`--merge`) to preserve shared
  ancestry between `main` and `develop`.
- Auto-merge commands:
  - Feature PRs: `gh pr merge --auto --squash --delete-branch`
  - Release PRs: `gh pr merge --auto --merge --delete-branch`

## Approved domain abbreviations

Domain-specific abbreviations that are well-established in the IBM MQ ecosystem
and may be used in identifiers without expansion:

- `qmgr` — queue manager (established MQSC domain term)

## Accepted naming deviations

Identifiers that intentionally diverge from general naming rules for readability
or domain alignment:

- `MqRestTransport transport` field in `MqRestSession` — the `MqRest` prefix on
  the type is redundant within the `MqRestSession` class context, so the field
  uses the shorter `transport` name rather than `mqRestTransport`.
